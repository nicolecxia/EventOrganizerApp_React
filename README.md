User can sign in or sign up with their email and password (Firebase authentication).
Once authenticated, they can view a list of events and log out.
Users can add, edit or remove events from their own event list. User should only be able to edit or remove an event if the same user has created it.
Implement a feature for saving an event as a favourite. User should be able to see all the favourite events in a separate list and should be able to remove an event from favourite list.
The events are stored in Firebase Firestore.
